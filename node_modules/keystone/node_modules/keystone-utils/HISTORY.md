## v0.3.0 / 2015-07-31

* changed; now shipping with the `slug` package by default

`limax` is now an optional package due to ongoing build issues with its dependencies on certain platforms. To use it (if you want support for Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese and Japanese characters) simply install it in your project; it will automatically be detected and used by `keystone-utils.slug()`.

* updated; `randomString` has now been published as its own package `randomkey`, still available as `utils.randomString`

## v0.2.2 / 2015-07-14

* updated; `limax` dependency, previous version was causing some build issues

## v0.2.0 / 2015-05-31

* added; [happiness](https://github.com/JedWatson/happiness) linter

* changed; now using [limax](https://github.com/lovell/limax) to generate slugs, which handles Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese and Japanese

Special thanks to [Arthur Chan](https://github.com/arthurtalkgoal) and [Lovell Fuller](https://github.com/lovell) for their help getting `limax` integrated and working with our tests!
